# Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)

This repository contains the code for developing, pretraining, and finetuning a GPT-like LLM and is the official code repository for the book [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](http://mng.bz/orYv).

In [*Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*](http://mng.bz/orYv), you'll learn and understand how large language models (LLMs) work from the inside out by coding them from the ground up, step by step. In this book, I'll guide you through creating your own LLM, explaining each stage with clear text, diagrams, and examples.

The method described in this book for training and developing your own small-but-functional model for educational purposes mirrors the approach used in creating large-scale foundational models such as those behind ChatGPT. In addition, this book includes code for loading the weights of larger pretrained models for finetuning.

## Hardware Requirements

The code in the main chapters of this book is designed to run on conventional laptops within a reasonable timeframe and does not require specialized hardware. This approach ensures that a wide audience can engage with the material. Additionally, the code automatically utilizes GPUs if they are available. (Please see the [setup](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/setup/README.md) doc for additional recommendations.)

## Questions, Feedback, and Contributing to This Repository


I welcome all sorts of feedback, best shared via the [Discussions](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/discussions) forum. Likewise, if you have any questions or just want to bounce ideas off others, please don't hesitate to post these in the forum as well.

If you notice any problems or issues, please do not hesitate to file an [Issue](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/issues).

However, since this repository contains the code corresponding to a print book, I currently cannot accept contributions that would extend the contents of the main chapter code, as it would introduce deviations from the physical book. Keeping it consistent helps ensure a smooth experience for everyone.
