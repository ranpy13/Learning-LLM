## Evaluating Instruction Responses Using the OpenAI API

- The [llm-instruction-eval-openai.ipynb](llm-instruction-eval-openai.ipynb) notebook uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to evaluate responses generated by instruction finetuned models. It works with a JSON file in the following format:

```python
{
    "instruction": "What is the atomic number of helium?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "The atomic number of helium is 2.",               # <-- The target given in the test set
    "model 1 response": "\nThe atomic number of helium is 2.0.", # <-- Response by an LLM
    "model 2 response": "\nThe atomic number of helium is 3."    # <-- Response by a 2nd LLM
},
```
