# Chapter 5: Pretraining on Unlabeled Data

- [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) contains all the code as it appears in the chapter
- [previous_chapters.py](previous_chapters.py) is a Python module that contains the `MultiHeadAttention` module from the previous chapter, which we import in [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) to pretrain the GPT model
- [gpt_train.py](gpt_train.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) to train the GPT model
- [gpt_generate.py](gpt_generate.py) is a standalone Python script file with the code that we implemented in [ch05.ipynb](ch05.ipynb) to load and use the pretrained model weights from OpenAI
