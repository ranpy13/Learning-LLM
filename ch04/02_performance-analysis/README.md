# Chapter 4: Implementing a GPT Model from Scratch To Generate Text

- [flops-analysis.ipynb](flops-analysis.ipynb) analyses the floating point operations per second (FLOPS) of the GPT model(s) implemented in the main chapter. 
- [previous_chapters.py](previous_chapters.py) is a Python module containing the `GPTModel` code we implemented in chapter 4 and other code implemented in previous chapters, which we import in the analysis notebook.
- `requirements-extra.txt` includes additional Python libraries that need to be installed (via `pip install -r requirements-extra.txt`.
